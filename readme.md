# Next.js + CSS

See [original README.md](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/blob/82e944a271c25cba7706db66b01d7e35b534aee1/packages/next-css/readme.md).

## About

This is a drop-in replacement for `@zeit/next-css`. Only now you have access to the latest features of `css-laoder` and `postcss-loader`.

⚠ Next.js comes with CSS support built-in. This plugin is only needed if you have to use other dependant plugins like `next-less`.
