# Fork of `next-css` plugin

See [original README.md](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/blob/master/packages/next-css/readme.md).

## Motivation

This fork is a drop-in replacement for `next-css` plugin. The only reason it was made was to update the then very old dependencies. Some corrections were made to work with newer APIs.
